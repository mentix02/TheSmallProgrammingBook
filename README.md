# The Small Programming Book
A small book written by me (that is still in development).

I like to read about and implement niche data structures and obscure algorithms but since I
couldn't find just one source for all different kinds of them with the appropriate Mathematics
to back them up, I decided to author my own _book_ that contained all this information.

The book is a collection of, mostly, Jupyter Notebook since I like Python but some of the more
low level concepts are written using C++ in the form of code embdedded in Markdown documents with
the appropriate (read: full) source code in their own directories.

The final book will be a PDF of all the notebooks and Markdown files.
