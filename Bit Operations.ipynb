    "# A Guide to Bitwise Operations & Shifts\n",
    "We, as little children, were taught to count using the decimal number system. There isn't any definitive reason why we chose that but there are [some speculations](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/317941/why-do-we-use-decimal-system). Regardless of that, some time in the past century, Computer Scientists, much like our budding selves, decided to use the binary number system for building computers but that wasn't as arbitrary a decision as our adoption of the decimal system.\n",
    "\n",
    "This decision involved a lot of reasons - one of them that the 1s and 0s in the form of high or low voltages are easily distinguishable as opposed to measuring different voltages as different numbers to accomodate more digits (thus having a higher base than 2). Another was that of classifiying different voltages would require more circuitry and time. And while these are very high level (and not complete by any measure) reasons for why the base-2 (binary) system was chosen, we need not overwhelm or concern ourselves with those decisions yet, this chapter focuses more on the types of operations we can do with binary numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we talk about _operations_, we don't mean the rules laid out by BODMAS (or PEDMAS) including the operations defined in them like addition, multiplication, etc. We want to talk about the special **bitwise** operations that we can perform for optimizing our calculations.\n",
